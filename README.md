# MagicBall

This is my first independent project. It was made in 2015, so long ago). I wanted to understand how to publish applications on my own, and started from Android. Unfortunately, the project came under the ban for the name “Magic8Ball” and even on the design, apparently of the ball itself, as I understood it from the correspondence with support. Later, I did a lot of things to get achieve for account blocking) As a lesson for the future from me, check all licenses, copyright and use rules before sending, and even better at the idea stage. You can see project here.
